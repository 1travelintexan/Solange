            I am from a small town in Portgual, and I have always been
            passionate about helping others. It was my dream to be a masseuse
            and now after many hours of studying and practicing, I am a licensed
            massage therapist located in beautiful Ericeria, Portugal. I
            Specialize in sport therapy but I am qualified to do many different
            styles of massage. If you are looking for a calm, relaxing afternoon
            or you want a deep tissue massage after a yoga or surf session I can
            give you a massage designed to loosen up all the soft tissue to
            avoid soreness the next day. I am looking forward to our next
            session. Contact me to schedule your next appointment!
